    "There are 2174 rows in the table which is the same as the number of missing values on both days_employed and total_income. Since it is exactly the same, this also says that there are no values missing only one of the two values. Thus, it can be generally believed that these entries are representative of people who are not currently employed.\n",
    "\n",
    "These points comprise roughly 10.1% of the data set. While it seems extremely large, it could be negligible if the data set itself is sufficiently large. However, it always would be preferable to fill missing values if there is a good way to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the days_employed and total_income are likely strong data to work with when performing analysis relating to loans, so they should probably be filled out. However, there may not be an elegant way to do so with the given data set, as the most clear predictors for such things (age, education, marital status) may not necessarily be able to form a whole model for such a complicated topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it would be auspicious to take a look over the subset and see if there are points that could be given a filler value of 0.0 indicating someone who is not simply in between jobs or who may simply be missing data for an unrelated reason. Students, spouses, and retirees would make the most sense to give this value. If they compose a sufficient portion of the data set, we could then make a decision on whether or not to drop the remaining values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the questions we are trying to answer are pertaining primarily to **income level**, **marital status**, **number of children** and **history of repaying loans**, those will be given focus."

    "**Possible reasons for missing values in data**\n",

    "Looking over some of the data with missing values, there could be some good ways to fill out some of the missing data. Looking quickly over the data, there are at 413 values that are missing value because their income_type is listed as 'retiree'. This makes sense, as they are retired, that means they would not be employed and as a result not have an income. There may be other factors involved, such as if someone is getting married and will not be working in the future, or is in between jobs, applying for college loans, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is 1 entrepreneur who naturally does not possess a fixed income or employment duration out of uncertainty so that entry should probably be safe to drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Married people make up 1237 rows, although there is naturally overlap with employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some who are on the younger end of the data, such as below age 23, a good number do appear to be pursuing education which could mean they do not hold a job and thus they would not have either of the values present. However, there also are 10 entries who have dob_years = 0, which holds for simple incomplete information. Since there are only 10 of them, I will drop those entries whose age is listed as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those with 0 children, or fewer than 2 children, make up most of the entries which are missing income data. This does make sense under a similar assumption to before - those who are in pursuit of their education are more likely to have fewer children, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check if the missing values are caused by random chance, a simple measure will be taken. We will take our prior ratios, the ones made by using our NULL data set, and create a second ratio based on the data set without including rows with null values, and subtract the first ratios from the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the result of this calculation is close to zero, then that means that the ratios we see in the null data set appear in roughly the same ratios as those in the data that has complete values. What this means, in brief, is that the missing data can be assumed as to have resulted from random chance. If, however, there is a significant difference between the two, that would suggest that perhaps there was a specific issue that caused a factor to have more missing data."

    "The ratio is 1% higher for retirees in the null set than the full set, which makes sense on an instinctual level. There also are 0.8% fewer employees in the null set, which signals that it is more likely an employee will have these data points represented in the full set. Additionally, the full set has parental leave, student, and unemployed values represented that are not present in the null set, but each of them comprises less than 0.0001 of the total data.\n",

If someone is living with a significant other, they may or may not be working.\n",

    "Those with 0 children are slightly less common in the full set and those with 1 child are slightly more common in the null set. If we assume that 0 children is more likely to be a student, this would make sense. 1 child could be simply random chance, but there is a plausible explanation in that one could interpolate that as a family goes from 1, to 2, or more children, the more likely there is that one of the parents stays at home (which seems to line up with the data).\n",

    "The difference in debt appears to be is more or less arbitrary. Someone may be less likely to acquire certain jobs if they have poor credit but as a whole credit should not have an impact on one's ability to find employment. There is only a 0.2686% difference between the sets.\n",

Students and employees, most obviously. For the remaining missing values. However, that may not be an ideal solution, and instead checking these values based on observed values would be more effective. For that, firstly, cleaning up data to make it more useable is important. Duplicates should be removed, data that is strikingly strange where it clearly is an error should be removed, columns should be normalized as much as possible. After the data has been cleaned, it will be in a state where it can be analyzed."

It would be a good idea to examine the way that the data was gathered if a process will be repeated in the future, but at the moment cleaning it is our priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the negative values, those are obvious and we only need to turn them positive. For the extremely large values of days_employed, we can witness that there are fewer values in the 10,000+ categories. There may be people who have been working for their entire life -16 years, and there also may be people who have been employed for many decades. By the time we reach a little over 15,000 days, the numbers begin to taper off and by the time we reach 20,000 days, all the values are also higher than 100,000. Most of them gather around a mean and median that both are approximately 336,000 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for the sufficiently large values, I would posit that the issue that any value with 6 digits has most likely been shifted by two figures. If we look at the values of the data that falls outside of the cutoff, the mean and median are around 2300 and 1600, respectively. This means that most of the people clearly do not reach 10,000 days of employment, and thus, it makes sense to alter values that have been employed for over 100,000 days into a four-digit value."

    "To discuss the possible predictors, starting with ones that are not useful predictors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone defaulting on a loan in the past does not seem to have a significant impact on their current income, nor generally does their number of children. Although families with exactly 3 children have higher incomes measured both in mean and median, and the median income of a 5-child household is also higher, but there are only 9 households with 5 children so it cannot be considered statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Marital status does not generally have an impact on income, but widows/widowers have a noticeably lower income. Generally, as the number of children in a household increases from 0 to 3, women tend to make less money and men tend to make more money - which makes sense, a stay-at-home parent is more likely to be a mother. Women in general tend to have a slightly lower income, with a wider gap if the household has more children. Also, in most cases, households with 4 children have a noticeable dip in income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it is a marriage or a civil partnership, the earning power of an individual does not appear to change significantly, although widows and widowers have lower earnings than divorcees. The income of people measured across married, unmarried, and divorced is fairly consistent, though especially so among women. Men's earning power across those three categories fluctuates a little more but is still relatively close.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suffice to say, there is a good reason to believe that measuring across the marital status, gender, and number of children in a household could be a useful predictor on a household income. However, this is not necessarily a perfect solution. The Standard Deviation across the data set is rather large, enough so that even an income of 0 would not be an outlier in many cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age group and education are far more clear-cut in that it rises as a worker peaks and then drops as they reach older ages, and also that their average income rises as they have more education. These values may sometimes be less consistent than the familial status, though in examination they do appear to have some sort of patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, filling things in with the median is a more practical choice. Due to the high standard deviation, it could be entirely suitable to simply fill all the empty values with the full data set's median income. Any sort of filler value we use could fluctuate wildly that it could also be a practical option to simply drop the missing values at this point. We would lose around 10% of the data set but there are tradeoffs if that 10% of the data is not present compared to if it is likely to be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though we will not be dropping them for the purposes of this analysis, instead filling using filtered data that usually has lower standard deviation compared to the full data as well as comparable or lower standard deviation than the data filtered by gender, does say a better option would be to use medians after the data is filtered in some way. Thus, it is possible a suitable choice will be to choose our filler values across the entire data set based on the age group and education status."

    "As expected, the medians are noticeably lower than the means. Whether the proposed explanation is true or not is not particularly relevant for our purposes at the moment. Regardless, for both the mean and the median there is a massive range of days employed across most distinctions (usually having some entries be under 1000 and others being nearly 4000). This could suggest that the mean is a better choice to use here.\n",

    "In particular, this is because the clearest pattern we see on the data is by taking the mean value of the data grouped by the ages. It has a steady increase of around 700 in each age group until the groups of 60-69 and 70+ (when we will see more retirees).\n",

These numbers look similar to the previous ones, although they are a little lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not appear that there is a large correlation between the family status and paying a loan back on time. Analyzing the family status along with the number of children, though, is something that should be examined. As we can see, there is a low rate of defaulting among married couples (and, oddly, divorcees and widows/widowers have even lower rates, when one would think that given their general lower income that they should be more likely to be unable to repay a loan).\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems a little odd if we consider that, based on children = 0 having the highest rate of paying back loans, we would expect unmarried people to not have the highest rate of defaulting. It may be in our best interest to examine how the two interact."

The rates of defaulting still are estimating to around 7-9%, which is the same as our previous tests and still close to our unfiltered defaulting rate of 8.1202%. However, in this case we do see a pattern that is completely unsurprising: As total_income rises, the rate of people who have failed to repay a loan steadily drops.\n",

    "# General Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "If there were any issues within the data set, it may be that there was a flaw in how the missing values were filled out. They were done so with very simple methodology that largely was looking only at a couple predictors, for ranges of numbers that were incredibly volatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point, we can say that even if there is a predictive effect that these factors have on whether or not someone will repay a loan, the effect is fairly small. In a largescale scenario, checking for someone's marital status, number of children, income level, or purpose for applying to a loan do seem to have an influence on whether or not they will default, however, the effect they do have in such situations is rather small.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a high-risk industry, however, it is suitable to use these small discrepancies as predictors. The results do appear to make logical sense as means to help predict a person's ability to repay a loan. Combining the number of children with the martial status makes a better estimate for that segment. The reason for taking out a loan may be better to analyze when taken in account with the age group of an individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, there is not much indication that the income level is a strong predictor of if one is able to pay back their loan. The default rate shown in the data set fluctuates a bit too much without a clear pattern. This may be a lack of information - the amount provided in the loan would be a good factor to account for, as well. Even if the purpose is the same, the amount loaned out is important. For instance, if two people are both attempting to take a loan for a car purchase, where one of them has an income of 15,000 and seeking a loan for a \\\\$20,000 used car and one holds an income of 30,000 but is seeking a loan for a \\\\$50,000 new car, it will be easier for the lower income person to pay back the loan. Additionally, 'total_income' does not appear to account for a household income, but only individual income."
